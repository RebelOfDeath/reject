/**
 * Returns the result of adding two expansions. 
 * * use `fastExpansionSum` instead, `fastExpansionSum` is nearly always 
 * preferred above this function.
 * 
 * Theorem 12: Let e = sum_(i=1)^m(e_i) and f = sum_(i=1)^n(f_i) be
 * nonoverlapping expansions of m and n-bit components respectively, where
 * p >= 3. Suppose that the components of both e and f are sorted in order of
 * increasing magnitude, except that any of the e_i or f_i may be zero. Then the
 * following algorithm will produce a nonoverlapping expansion h such that
 * h = sum_(i=1)^(m+n)(h_i) = e + f, where the components of h are in order of
 * increasing magnitude, except that any of the h_i may be zero. Furthermore, if
 * e and f are nonadjacent and round-to-even tiebreaking is used, then h is 
 * nonadjacent.
