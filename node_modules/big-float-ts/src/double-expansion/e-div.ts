/**
 * Returns the result of a/b using Goldschmidt division. 
 * 
 * The result will only be exact if b|a, i.e. if b divides a exactly, else the 
 * result will be rounded to the longest bitlength between a and b.
 * 
 * @param a the numerator
 * @param b the denominator
 * 
 * @param expansionLength the bitlength/53 of the final result, e.g. 1 means
 * standard double precision, 2 means double-double, etc up to a max of about 20 at
 * which point underflow cease precision improvement. If the division is known
 * to be exact beforehand (such as in the pseudo remainder sequence algorithm) 
 * then set expansionLength === 0 and an exact division will be done.
