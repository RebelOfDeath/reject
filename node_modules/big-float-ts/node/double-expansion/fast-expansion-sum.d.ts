/**
 * Returns the result of adding two expansions.
 *
 * Theorem 13: Let e = sum_(i=1)^m(e_i) and f = sum_(i=1)^n(f_i) be strongly
 * nonoverlapping expansions of m and n p-bit components, respectively, where
 * p >= 4. Suppose that the components of both e and f are sorted in order of
 * increasing magnitude, except that any of the e_i or f_i may be zero. On a
 * machine whose arithmetic uses the round-to-even rule, the following algorithm
 * will produce a strongly nonoverlapping expansion h such that
 * sum_(i=1)^(m+n)(e_i + f_i) = e + f, where the components of h are also in
 * order of increasing magnitude, except that any of the h_i may be zero.
