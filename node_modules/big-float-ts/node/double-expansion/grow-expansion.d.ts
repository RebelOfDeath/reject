/**
 * Returns the result of adding a double to an expansion.
 *
 * Let e be a nonoverlapping expansion of m p-bit components, and let b be a
 * p-bit value where p >= 3. Suppose that the components e_1, ..., e_m are
 * sorted in order of *increasing* magnitude, except that any of the ei may be
 * zero.
 * Then the following algorithm will produce a nonoverlapping expansion such
 * that h = sum_i(h_i) = e + b, where the components h_1, ..., h_(m+1) are also
 * in order of increasing magnitude, except that any of the h_i may be zero.
 * Furthermore, if e is nonadjacent and round-to-even tiebreaking is used, then
 * h is nonadjacent.
 * See https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/papers/robustr.pdf
 * @param e A floating point expansion
 * @param b Another floating point expansion
