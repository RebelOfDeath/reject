/**
 * Returns the product of two double floating point expansions.
 *
 * * see [Shewchuk](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/papers/robustr.pdf)
 *
 * As per Shewchuk in the above paper: "To find the product of two expansions
 * e and f, use SCALE-EXPANSION (with zero elimination) to form the expansions
 * ef_1, ef_2, ..., then sum these using a distillation tree."
 *
 * A distillation tree used with fastExpansionSum will give O(k*log k) vs O(k^2)
 * operations.
 *
 * Implemented naively and not as described by Shewchuk (i.e. the algorithm
 * takes O(k^2) operations).
 * @param e a double floating point expansion
 * @param f another double floating point expansion
