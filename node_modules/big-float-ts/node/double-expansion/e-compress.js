/**
 * Returns the result of compressing the given floating point expansion.

 * * see [Shewchuk](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/papers/robustr.pdf)
 *
 * Theorem 23 (Shewchuck): Let e = sum_(i=1)^m(e_i) be a nonoverlapping
 * expansion of m p-bit components, where m >= 3. Suppose that the components of
 * e are sorted in order of increasing magnitude, except that any of the e_i may
 * be zero. Then the following algorithm will produce a nonoverlapping expansion
 * (nonadjacent if round-to even tiebreaking is used) such that
 * h = sum_(i=1)^n(h_i) = e, where the components h_i are in order of increasing
 * magnitude. If h != 0, none of the h_i will be zero. Furthermore, the largest
 * component h_n approximates h with an error smaller than ulp(h_n).
