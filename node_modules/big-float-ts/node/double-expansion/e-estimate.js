/**
 * Returns the result of the given floating point expansion rounded to a double
 * floating point number.
 *
 * The result is within 1 ulps of the actual value, e.g. imagine the worst case
 * situation where we add (in 4dot4) 1111.1000 + 0.000011111111... The result
 * will be 1111.1000 whereas as the correct result should be 1111.1001 and we
 * thus lost 1 ulp of accuracy. It does not matter that the expansion contain
 * several floats since none is overlapping.
 *
